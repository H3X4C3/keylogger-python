# KeyLogger
This is one of my personal projects, trying to create a keylogger that will be updated to support the following:
- [x] Basic keylogger to work, capturing keystrokes and placing them into a file on the local machine
- [ ] Print keystrokes to a file, that will be sent to user's email
- [ ] Capture keystrokes from another computer and send them via a file into local machine




*This README will be updated as needed*
